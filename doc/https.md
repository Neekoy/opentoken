HTTPS
=====

HTTPS for OpenToken.io can be enabled by adding/updating a configuration option in config.json.

The default settings do not enable HTTPS.

    {
        "server": {
            "port": 8443,
        }
        ...
    }

If the server is going to need/want HTTPS then there are a few things to do.

First the server will need to a Private Key file and a Certificate file. These can be generated for testing and development.


Generating SSL Files for Testing
--------------------------------

In order to generate the files needed for testing and development there are several commands which need to be ran. These commands were pulled from [The Most Common OpenSSL Commands](https://www.sslshopper.com/article-most-common-openssl-commands.html).

    openssl req -out CSR.csr -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout privateKey.key

There will be several prompts for information: Below is an example for getting it to work using localhost.

    Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:US
    State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:Washington
    Locality Name (eg, city) []:Redmond
    Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:Some Company
    Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:A Division
    Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:localhost
    Email Address []:some.one@example.net

    There are a few "extra" options, these aren't required to make the site work.
    A challenge password []:
    An optional company name []: If there is an optional company name enter it here.

Do not enter a password because the config file does not support entering a password at this time.

This will create a Private Key file and a Certificate Signing Request file. We aren't done yet though, we still need to generate a Self-Signed Certificate file.

    openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout privateKey.key -out certificate.crt

The same questions will be prompted from above except for the "extra" ones.


Updating `config.json`
----------------------

Once the keys are generated, they can be added under the "server" property.  Only the private key and the certificate are required.

    {
        "server": {
            "certificateFile": "./certificate.crt",
            "keyFile": "./privateKey.key",
            "port": 8443
        }
        ...
    }

When set, the server will attempt to load these files and start the server up using HTTPS.

An easy way to see if this works is to go to `https://hostname:8443/`.  Replace `hostname` with your server's name or use `localhost` if developing on your own machine.  You will get a warning about not being able to verify the certificate, but you will have an encrypted connection.

Optionally you can run the command:

    openssl s_client -connect hostname:port

This will provide information about the connection and whether it detects certificates are installed.
